*<b>However we will only be using A.i (ChatGPT) to create the game, only giving it prompts!</b>*

From this we will have to figure out
* How to use correct prompts to form a game
* How to troubleshoot errors without going in and fixing the errors manually
* Setting constraints on games environment we want it to be ran (redplit)
* Etc, etc.
